The goal of the ELKS project is to create a Linux kernel for:<br><br>
<ul><li>8086 and 80286 class <a hRef="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> Personal Computer compatible systems,
	<li>Palmtop Computers, such as the <a href="http://www.psion.com">Psion</a> SiBO (Sixteen Bit Organiser),
	<li>Single board microcomputers,
	<li>Embedded controller systems, <i>and</i>
	<li>Other old computers.</ul>

The current status of the ELKS project on the various supported architectures is:
<ol><li>ELKS currently runs on IBM Personal Computer compatible systems. On this architecture, the ELKS kernel image needs about 200K, and a full running system should require between 400K and 512K of RAM.
	<li>ELKS currently runs on the Psion SiBO (Sixteen Bit Organiser) palmtop computer.
	<li>There is no known version of ELKS for any other architecture.</ol>
The <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> operating system is used as the development platform for ELKS at the moment.<br><br>
The ELKS source releases include ready built kernel and root disk images to ease first steps with ELKS.
