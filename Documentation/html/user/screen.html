						<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><BR><B>Introduction<BR><BR></B>Screen
						is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
						terminal between several processes, typically interactive
						shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC
						VT100 terminal. <BR><BR>When screen is called, it creates a
						single window with a shell in it and then gets out of your way
						so that you can use the program as you normally would. Then, at
						any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other
						programs in them (including more shells), kill the current
						window, view a list of the active windows, switch between
						windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely
						independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their
						window is currently not visible.<BR><BR>Everything you type is
						sent to the program running in the current window. The only
						exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate
						a command to the window manager. By default, each command
						begins with a control-a, and is followed by one other
						keystroke. <BR><BR>The standard way to create a new window is
						to type Ctrl-a c. This creates a new window running a shell and
						switches to that window immediately, regardless of the state of
						the process running in the current window. <BR><BR><B>History<BR><BR></B>The
						first version of the screen program was published on 20th March
						1987 by Oliver Laumann, Technical University of Berlin, on the
						net.sources group. This was version 1.1b and called &bdquo;BSD
						screen manager&ldquo;. For ELKS the version 2.01a was used
						which was published on 19th October 1988. This is already a
						much extended version from 1.1b. <BR><BR>This document covers
						the features implemented in the version used by ELKS.
						<BR><BR><B>Invoking screen<BR><BR></B>Screen supports the
						following command line parameters:<BR><BR>&lsquo;-a&rsquo;
						<BR>Include all capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in
						each window&rsquo;s termcap, even if screen must redraw parts
						of the display in order to implement a function.<BR> <BR>&lsquo;-e
						xy&rsquo; <BR>Set the command character to x, and the character
						generating a literal command character (when typed after the
						command character) to y. The defaults are Ctrl+a and a, which
						can be specified as &lsquo;-eAa&rsquo;. This option is
						equivalent to the command escape in the .screenrc file.<BR><BR>&lsquo;-f&rsquo;
						<BR>Set flow-control to on.<BR><BR>&lsquo;-n&rsquo; <BR>turns
						off flow-control<BR><BR>&lsquo;-r&lsquo; <BR>Resume a detached
						screen session. No other options may be specified. This feature
						is currently disabled for ELKS.<BR><BR><B>Commands<BR><BR></B>While
						in a screen session you can send the following commands to
						screen. Each keyboard command consists of a Ctrl-a character
						followed by one other character. This character can also be
						pressed in combination with the CTRL key.<BR><BR>Ctrl+a ?
						Displays commands and their defaults (help)<BR>Ctrl+a c Create
						a new window (with shell) (shell)<BR>Ctrl+a n Switch to the
						next window. (next)<BR>Ctrl+ p Switch to the previous window

						Currently disabled.<BR><BR>You can also specify these commands
						in the .screenrc file, the command keywords for this are
						specified in brackets above.<BR><BR><B>The .screenrc file<BR></B><BR>When
						screen is invoked, it executes initialization commands from the
						file .screenrc in the user&rsquo;s home directory.<BR>Commands
						in this file are used to set options, bind commands to keys,
						and to automatically establish one or more windows at the
						beginning of your screen session. Commands are listed one per
						line, with empty lines being ignored. A command&rsquo;s
						arguments are separated by tabs or spaces, and may be
						surrounded by single or double quotes. A &lsquo;#&rsquo; turns
						the rest of the line into a comment, except in quotes.
						<BR><BR>Commands in `.screenrc' are mainly used to
						automatically establish a number of windows each time screen is
						called, and to bind functions to specific keys.  In this
						version of screen, the following initialization commands are
						supported in the .screenrc
						file:<BR>screen<BR>escape<BR>bind<BR>bell<BR>chdir<BR>mode<BR><BR>a)
						Screen Command<BR><BR>screen [n] [cmds args]<BR><BR>Establish a
						window. If an optional number n in the range 0..9 is given, the
						window number n is assigned to the newly created window (or, if
						this number is already in use, the next higher number). Note
						that n has a value of zero for the standard shell window
						created after `.screenrc'  has been read.  If a command is
						specified after `screen', this command (with the given
						arguments) is started in the window; if no command is given, a
						shell is created in the window.	Thus, if your `.screenrc'
						contains the lines<BR><BR># example for .screenrc:<BR>screen
						1<BR>screen 2 /usr/ucb/telnet foobar<BR><BR>screen creates a
						shell window (window #1), a window with a TELNET connection to
						the machine foobar (window #2), and, finally, a second shell
						window (the default window) which gets a window number of zero.
						 When the initialization is completed, screen always switches
						to the default window, so window #0 is displayed when the above
						`.screenrc' is used.<BR> <BR>b) Command Character<BR><BR>escape
						xy<BR><BR>Set the command character to x and the character
						generating a literal command character to y. Because it is
						difficult to enter a control character in a file with an
						editor, in the ELKS version you enter the letter you want to
						combine with the CTRL key. So &quot;B&ldquo; will be converted
						by screen for ELKS to Ctrl+B.<BR>The escapes command can be
						used to specify a different command character and a character
						which, when typed immediately after the command character,
						generates a literal command character.  The defaults for these
						two characters are &quot;Ctrl+a&quot; and &bdquo;a&ldquo;'. It
						may be necessary to change this combination because Ctrl+a is
						mapped to the common command beginning-of-line in GNU Readline.
						Linenoise and Bash-like shells. <BR><BR>c) Bind Command<BR><BR>bind
						key [function | cmd args]<BR><BR>Bind a function to a key.  By
						default, each function provided by screen is bound to one or
						more keys as indicated by the above  table,  e.g.  the function
						to  create a new window is bound to &quot;C-c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.
						The `bind' command can be used to redefine the key bindings and
						to define new bindings.  The key argument is either a single
						character, a sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; meaning &quot;C-x&quot;,
						or an octal number specifying the ASCII code  of the character.
						 If no further argument is given, any previously established
						binding for this key is removed.  The function argument can be
						one of the keywords mentioned in the Commands section
						above.<BR><BR>In addition, a key can be bound such that a
						window is created running a different command than the shell
						when that key is pressed.  In this case, the pathname of the
						command optionally followed by arguments must be given instead
						of one of the above-listed keywords; the pathname must start
						with a `/'.  For example, the commands<BR><BR>bind ' '
						windows<BR>bind ^f /usr/ucb/telnet foobar<BR>bind 033
						/bin/su<BR><BR>1)would bind the space key to the function that
						displays a list of windows (that is, the function usually
						invoked by &quot;Ctrl+a w&quot; would also be	available
						as	Ctrl+a  space, <BR>2)bind &quot;Ctrl+f&quot; to the function
						&quot;create a window with a TELNET connection to foobar&quot;,
						<BR>3) and bind &quot;escape&quot; to the function that creates
						a window with a super-user shell.<BR><BR>d) Bell command<BR><BR>When
						a bell character is sent to a background window, screen
						displays a notification in the message line.  The notification
						message can be redefined by means of the &quot;bell&quot;
						command. Each occurrence of `%' in message is replaced by the
						number of the window to which a bell has been sent. The default
						message is<BR><BR>'Bell in window %'<BR><BR>An empty message
						can be supplied to the &quot;bell&quot; command to suppress
						output of a message line (bell &quot;&quot;).<BR><BR>bell
						&quot;&quot;<BR>bell &quot;The bell rang in window %&quot;<BR><BR>e)
						Chdir command<BR><BR>chdir [directory]<BR><BR>Change the
						current directory of screen to the specified directory or, if
						called without an argument, to your home directory  (the 
						value	 of  the environment  variable $HOME).  All windows that
						are created by means of the &quot;screen&quot; command from
						within &quot;.screenrc&quot; use this as their default
						directory.  Without a chdir command, this would be the
						directory from which screen was invoked.   Hardcopy files are
						always written to the window's default directory, not the
						current directory of the process running in the window. <BR><BR>There
						is an example .screenrc file included in the elkscmd/screen
						directory in the ELKS sources.<BR><BR>Additional information is
						available in the man page screen.1 in the elks/elkscmd/screen
						directory. Open this fle with &bdquo;man ./screen.1&ldquo; or
						man will search in the &bdquo;/usr&ldquo; directory first and
						load the latest version of this file installed with your Linux
						distro. This will cover the features in the latest screen
						version which are not available in this version provided with
						ELKS.<BR><BR>30.04.20 Georg Potthast</FONT></P>
