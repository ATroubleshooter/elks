			<H2 CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Writing
			applications for ELKS in C</SPAN></H2>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">ELKS
			and application programs for ELKS are cross-compiled on a standard
			Linux system with the dev86 package. This contains the bcc C
			compiler, the ld86 linker, the as86 assembler and the ar86
			archiver. You can download the dev86 package from the repository
			of your Linux distribution or download it here:
			<A HREF="https://github.com/jbruchon/dev86">https://github.com/jbruchon/dev86</A>
			and compile and install it from this source code.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
			package also includes the elksemu program which allows 8086 ELKS
			programs to be run under Linux-i386. These programs can be
			compiled using the bcc compiler. However, elksemu will not run on
			64bit Linux distributions. Therefore test the programs using Qemu
			instead as described in the next chapter.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">For
			a start let's compile a &bdquo;hello world&ldquo; program and run
			that in ELKS. Here is the code:</FONT></P>
			<PRE CLASS="western">#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
        printf(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;);
        return 0;
}</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
			<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Copy and save this as hello.c with
			a text editor. Then enter </FONT>
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">bcc -ansi hello.c -o hello</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
			<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">We will always use the -ansi switch
			because otherwise bcc will assume K&amp;R style. </FONT>
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">To
			run this program in ELKS there are three alternatives. You can
			load an existing ELKS image as a loop device on Linux and copy the
			new executable to this image. Then run the image using qemu. Or
			you make a directory in the ELKS source code, write a Makefile for
			that and compile ELKS including your program. Finally, you could
			set up an ftp server on your host and use the ftpget progam on
			ELKS to download the executable to ELKS and run it there.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">It
			is described now, how to use the loop device to add the executable
			to the directory usr/bin in an existing ELKS image file named
			full3. For this you can make a script with the following lines:</FONT></P>
			<PRE CLASS="western">set -x
cd ..
mount -o loop full3 floppy1
cp bccdev/hello floppy1/usr/bin
umount floppy1
cd bccdev</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
			<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This assumes that you are
			developing in the directory &bdquo;bccdev&ldquo; and that the
			full3 image file is in the directory above that. Also in the
			directory above there has to be the floppy1 directory which will
			be used for the loop device. You have to execute the script with
			&bdquo;sudo&ldquo; !</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">You
			may wonder why Linux can access this floppy image since it is
			using the Minix file system which is the only file system ELKS
			supports. The reason is that Linux uses the Minix file system for
			floppy disks as well.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">After
			running the script call qemu to run ELKS and execute your program:</FONT></P>
			<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">qemu-system-i386 -fda ../full3</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
			<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Log in as &bdquo;root&ldquo; and
			type cd /usr/bin and execute the hello program in there. If you
			have to repeat this frequently while developing your program, you
			can put these commands into the &bdquo;.profile&ldquo; script for
			root. Then your program will be run as soon as you log in as root.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">bcc
			generates programs with either up to 64k or 128k in size.
			Currently ELKS can only load programs generated for 128k. In the
			case of 64k both the code and data are in the same segment while
			if you select 128k it will be up to 64k of code and up to 64k of
			data and stack in two separate segments. This is determined with
			the -i switch. If you do not use that, bcc will pass this to the
			linker as default and generate 128k programs. The programs that
			are included in ELKS therefore are 128k programs. However, if you
			enter &bdquo;bcc -i&ldquo; then bcc will not pass &bdquo;-i&ldquo;
			to the linker and thus generate 64k programs. There is also the -H
			switch which bcc will pass on to the linker. This shall determine
			the top of the heap address which is the initial stack address.
			You can enter this in hex as e.g. 0xF800.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If
			an error number is returned you can look that up in the file
			&bdquo;elks\include\arch\errno.h&ldquo;.</FONT></P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
			bcc compiler has been ported to DOS so you can also develop ELKS
			applications in DOS or a Windows 32bit DOS box:

			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Alfonso
			Martone found a way to convert DOS Turbo-C programs to enable
			these to run with ELKS:

			<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">For that he developed the exe2elks
			DOS utility program and a small libc without DOS system calls. The
			exe2elks program may work for DOS TASM assembler programs as well
			if you get TLINK to generate a map file.</FONT></P>
