<h1>Running ELKS in QEMU</h1>

<p>Last QEMU version tested: 2.7.0</p>

<p>QEMU is the prefered emulator to test ELKS, as it is mainstream, is able to
emulate a pure ISA machine, and provides some useful debug facilities, like
the guest network dump.</p>

<p>Another emulator is <a href="https://github.com/jbruchon/dev86/tree/master/emu86">
EMU86</a> (part of the DEV86 project), but is more intended
for low level debugging for the ELKS developers.</p>

<p>To run ELKS in QEMU, use the launcher script in:</p>
<pre>
cd .../elks
./qemu.sh
</pre>

<p>Edit this script to customize your QEMU configuration. It contains some comments
to explain the most useful options.<p>

<h2>ELKS networking in QEMU</h2>

<p>The <strong>ktcp</strong> network process and the <strong>NE2K</strong>
Ethernet driver run well on QEMU.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do networking in QEMU is the "user" mode. In this mode,
QEMU connects the ELKS Ethernet interface (default address 10.0.2.15) to a
guest VLAN, with a router at default address 10.0.2.2. That router acts as
a gateway that performs outgoing and incoming NAT.</p>

<p>That router does not forward ICMP packets, so you cannot ping ELKS from the
host and ELKS cannot ping ip addresses beyond the 10.0.2.0 network. However,
there is no ping utility on ELKS yet.</p>

<p>Outgoing connections work without additional configuration. For incoming
connections, use the "host-to-guest" forwarding of the guest VLAN.</p>

<p>In the following example, we tell QEMU to listen on port 2323 on the host
local address 127.0.0.1, and to redirect to port 23 on ELKS, so that we can
telnet to ELKS:</p>

<pre>
qemu.sh: -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2323-10.0.2.15:23
telnet 127.0.0.1 2323
</pre>

<p>In the following example, we tell QEMU to listen on port 8080 on the host
local address 127.0.0.1, and to redirect to port 80 on ELKS, so that we can
query the httpd process on ELKS:</p>

<pre>
qemu.sh: -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:8080-10.0.2.15:80
wget 127.0.0.1:8080
</pre>

<p>To capture and dump the packets from the user VLAN, use the option:</p>
<pre>
qemu.sh: -net dump
</pre>

<p>Then use TcpDump or Wireshark to display the network trafic:</p>
<pre>
tcpdump -r qemu-vlan0.pcap
</pre>
