This is an attempt at creating a BusyBox-like set of binaries
for ELKS.

To build it, you will need to copy your existing ELKS include
headers to the bcc include directory. bcc uses severely out of
date header files, and it turns out that some of these tools
require newer headers to function. Mine was located at
/usr/lib/bcc/include but your location will vary.

I am awful at Makefiles, so I wrote a rudimentary Makefile and 
wrote a shell script to oversee the build process. Run ./build 
and wait for it. When it's finished, you will have three
BusyELKS binaries and a series of symbolic links for them.
They will be set up under the _install/ directory exactly as
they need to appear in the ELKS system's root.

These compile and work under "elksemu," but I have not tested 
them under ELKS itself yet, because of one major bug I ran into: 

THE INIT PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK IN BUSYELKS FOR SOME REASON.

If someone can figure out why, it would be appreciated.

Please compile and test this out, perhaps substituting the normal 
/sbin/init to at least get a bootable system.
