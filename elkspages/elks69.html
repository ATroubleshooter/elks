ELKS 0.0.69 has been released and is available from ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk.
There are two files included in this release:-

	elks-0.0.69.tar.gz - Kernel source.
	images.zip - Boot, root and combined disk images.

This is a kernel only release, there have been no changes to the user code.
For user space sources see elks-0.0.69-pre1. Major features in this release
are:-

IDE HD support

Blaz Antonic has been working for some time on this driver, which is now
included for testing. Neither myself or Blaz have been able to try this
out although it does correctly detect IDE drives on a machine I have access to.
If you have an IDE (not EIDE) drive that you can spare, please give this driver
a try. Bug reports should go to the list, not to me, as I know very little 
about the code.

Console support for Hercules cards

Erik (surname not provided) submitted a patch that fixes VC support for 
Hercules cards (I think). I have not been able to test it, but it did not
break anything, so I included it. This may or may not fix the bug that was 
reported on the list recently. This patch also included a change that 
disables XT memory test on C-A-D, and a patch to the boot code.

Support for single combined boot/root floppy

I have included in images.zip a 720K disk image that uses Rob de Baths minix
boot sector and contains and minix filesystem and a kernel image. The kernel
has been patched so that if the boot disk contains a minix filesystem, it
does not prompt the user to insert a root floppy. I have tested this and
it seems to work fine. This patch will be okay with the direct IDE driver, but
will break if a direct floppy driver becomes available.

The first two features need testing badly, as I have not been able to, so please
give this version a try.
