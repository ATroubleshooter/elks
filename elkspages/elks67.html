<b>Subject:</b> ELKS 0.0.67 on ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk
</h3>
</p>
<p>
ELKS 0.0.67 has been released and is available from the following URL:
</p>
<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/elks/elks-0.0.67">ftp://ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/elks/elks-0.0.67</a>
</p>
<p>
As usual three files are available:-
</p>
<p>
elks-0.0.67.tar.gz	- Kernel Source<br>
elkscmd.tar.gz		- User space source<br>
images.zip		- Boot and root disk images<br>
</p>
<p>
Major new kernel features in this release:
</p>
<p>
Firstly the kernel source should now be unpacked in /usr/src/elks rather that<br>
/usr/src/linuc-86/elks. Rob and I have agreed this as elks and dev86 are<br>
independant packages. This will also allow dev86 to use the kernel include<br>
files properlly, and get to the syscall.dat file in the kernel source tree.<br>
This should solve the problem people were having with the wrong version of<br>
syscall.dat being distributed with dev86.<br>
</p>
<p>
Blaz Antonic's lp driver is now included, with some modifications by me. I don't<br>
know if this works as I have no working printer on my test machines, and no<br>
working printer.<br>
</p>
<p>
I have added module code to the kernel based on code written by Rob. This allows<br>
drivers to be compiled separatly from the kernel and then loaded into the kernel<br>
at runtime. Only one module can be loaded at once. For information on how<br>
this works see the documentation in elks/Documentation/modules.txt, and see<br>
the files elks/modules/* and kernel/module.c. If there are any qeries I will<br>
answer questions on the list. Included on the root disk is the program<br>
insmod used to install a module, and serial.D and serial.T, the serial<br>
driver compiled as a module. insmod removed the previous module before loading<br>
a new one, so there is no need for rmmod.<br>
</p>
<p>
The irq code that I was having problems with is now fixed, but the serial<br>
driver still cannot receive characters. I haven't had much time to look at the<br>
code. Output is now much faster thanks to some changes made to both the serial<br>
driver and the tty layer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Added a CONFIG option which allows the VT52 emulation of the console code to be<br>
removed which frees up a lot of kernel space. Could be useful for those users<br>
who need to squeeze in that extra feature.<br>
</p>
<p>
Shane Kerr's patch to add time functionality has been added, but is not<br>
tested. Shane, please let me know if it works. If so, is there any chance you<br>
could complete the job and implement the kernel xtime variable correctly<br>
so that file data and time stamps are correctly updated.<br>
</p>
<p>
Serious debugging code added to the interrupt code so that we can get more<br>
insight into the "panic: unable to get timer" problem.<br>
</p>
<p>
Many bug fixes, and code trimmings.<br>
</p>
<p>
User Space<br>
</p>
<p>
The root disk now contains the fixed version of fdisk, which works fine for me.<br>
The new login program with password support is also included. I tested the<br>
passwd program provided, but it just deleted my passwd file.<br>
</p>
<p>
Please feel free to send bug reports directly to me. My feed from the list is <br>
still dodgey.<br>
