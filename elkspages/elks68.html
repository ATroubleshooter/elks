<b>Subject:</b> ELKS 0.0.68 on ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk
</h3>
</p>
<p>
ELKS 0.0.68 has been released and is now available for dowload from
<p>
<a
href="ftp://ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/elks/elks-0.0.68">ftp://ftp.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/elks/elks-0.0.68</a>
</p> 
 <P>  The release consists of four files:
 <P>  <!-- indent --><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elks-0.0.68.tar.gz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- kernel source
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elkscmd.tar.gz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- user programs
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;images.zip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- boot and root images
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;libc_select.tgz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- patch to libc
 <P>  This releases the last known cause of the timer bug, which is a problem
 pointed out by Alan Cox with a hole reserved in low memory.
 <P>  It is still possible a bug may be caused by the console driver on monochrom
 systems.
 <P>  Kernel changes
 <PRE><SMALL>--------------
 
 With this version we should now see an end to the timer panic. The
 kernel will now explicitly say if it is restarted, and will show a
 stack backtrace whenever it panics. (Thanks for the patch). From now
 on it should be much easier to find out why something paniced, but users
 will have to include the full stack backtrace in bug reports.
 
 This version contains Patrick Lams select patch which I have not yet looked
 at. As part of this patch support for run queue's bottom ends, task
 queue's and timers has been included, though I have commented a lot of this
 out to save space. The libc patch file contains the changes required to
 libc in order to try out the new select call. This is necessary as 
 select uses five parameters.
 
 I have added support to this version for the System V terminal control
 calls. I have implemented the TCGETA and TCSETA ioctl calls, and some
 of the features of the termio structure. This is sufficient for a
 modified version of levee (a vi clone) that is included in elkscmd, and on the 
 root disk, to run fairly cleanly. I can't get escape to work at the moment, but
 it all works fine as long as you don't go into insert mode. :-)
 NOTE - ELKS does not currently support the POSIX TCGETS and TCSETS ioctls, and
 the termios structure which is similar but larger than termio. Most of the
 software I have found that would be suitable for ELKS uses termio, so I
 have stuck with that for now. I think support for both would cause too
 much bloat.
 
 This release includes changes bu Blaz Antonic to the lp driver and doshd
 driver. The lp driver now detects ports using the BIOS and prints okay
 on my printer. This prevents it getting confused by finding serial ports
 where it expects to find parallel ports. If you have a printer please
 test this driver by copying a text file to the /dev/lp0 device, and 
 see if it prints. Please report any dropped characters or other problems to
 the list. 
 
 The disk driver has been changed so it now uses a more flexible floppy probe
 routine. This should help people using non standard floppy sizes.
 
 Shane Kerrs time change were added around 0.0.68-pre2, but this is the first
 full release with them in. The clock and date programs on the root disk
 can be used with the CMOS clock and and system clock respectively. On my
 system clock is able to read the CMOS clock, but cannot correctly set the
 system time from it.
 
 
 I have also made loads of bugfix changes, and code reductions particularly to
 the block device code.
