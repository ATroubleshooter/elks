               ELKS, the Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset
               ----------------------------------------

This is a project to write a Linux-like operating system for ancient
computers running an Intel 8086-compatible processor.

To build ELKS, you will need a cross build chain, mainly based on DEV86, and
also on GCC-IA16 if you select that latest in place of BCC to build the kernel.

A script is provided to automatically download and build that cross chain:

  'tools/build.sh'

Note: all the scripts must be executed with top directory 'elks/' as the current one.

A script that attempts to automate the whole build process and make it easier
for ELKS newbies has been provided:

  './build.sh'

If you want to clean everything up afterwards, run './build.sh clean'
and it will run 'make clean' in the build directories for you.

The general build procedure for ELKS is as follows:

* Build the cross chain in 'cross/' (see above)

* Set up your environment (PATH, TOPDIR and CROSSDIR):

  '. tools/env.sh' (note the '.' before the script)

* Configure the build chain, the kernel, the commands and select the target
  image format (the default configuration is for an IBM PC/XT/AT):
  
  'make menuconfig'

* Build the kernel and the commands:

  'make all'

* Build the target image as a user with the 'sudoer' privilege:

  'cd elkscmd'
  'make image'

The target root directory is built in 'target/', and depending on your
configuration, that directory is packed as either a floppy disk image (fd1440,
fd1680, fd1200, fd720, fd360, without MBR), a hard-disk image (hd, with MBR),
or a file image (rom, tar).

Before writting the image on the real device, you can test it first on QEMU with
'./qemu.sh' (will configure QEMU to be close as possible to an ISA system).
