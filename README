               ELKS, the Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset
               ----------------------------------------

This is a project to write a Linux-like operating system for ancient
computers running an Intel 8086-compatible processor. To build ELKS, you
will need to obtain a copy of Dev86, currently available at:

https://github.com/lkundrak/dev86

When you build dev86, you need to move, copy, or symlink to it in the
ELKS source code root. For a Dev86 source at /usr/src/dev86 do this:

user:/usr/src/elks$ ln -s /usr/src/dev86 dev86

The general build procedure is as follows:

* Build Dev86, usually with default options
* Make sure 'dev86' is beside 'elks' 'elkscmd' etc.
* 'cd elks'
* 'make menuconfig' and configure the kernel
* Run 'make' to build the kernel
* 'cd ../elkscmd'
* 'make' (builds the core command line utilities)
* 'cd ../elksnet'
* 'make' (builds the networking components)
* 'cd ../elkscmd'
* As root, run 'make [imagetype]' where image type is one of these:
  - full3: 1.44MB 3.5" floppy image, all-inclusive
  - full5: 1.2MB 5.25" floppy image, all-inclusive
  - comb: 720K floppy image, ELKS kernel plus minimal root filesystem
  - comb_net: Same as 'comb' but with 'elksnet' components included
  - boot: 360K floppy image, ELKS kernel only
  - root: 360K floppy image, minimal root filesystem only
  - images.zip: make every image type and zip them all into "images.zip"
