.SH NAME
ne0 \- Driver for the ne1k and ne2k ISA Ethernet controller family
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
ne1k, ne2k
	/bootopts: ne0=9,0x380,,0x80
	/dev/ne0 - major: 9 minor: 0
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBne0\fP 
device refers to the ELKS driver for the ne1k/ne2k family of 10Mbps 
Ethernet interfaces (aka NICs) running
on the PC ISA 8 or 16 bit bus. The 
\fBne2k\fP
has a full width 16 bit (double) edge connector an may be used in 16 or 8 bit modes. The
.B ne1k
has a single, 8bit wide edge connector and is an 8 bit only device.
.PP
The driver will automatically recognize the type of controller and adjust settings accordingly. 
The actual settings will be displayed at boot time.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The default settings for the interface are set in the
.I ports.h 
file in the ELKS source tree, see the FILES section below. These settings may conveniently
be overridden at boot-time via the
.I /bootopts
file using the syntax shown in the SYNOPSIS section above.
.PP
The first parameter is the IRQ (decimal), 
the second is the base I/O port address (in hexadecimal), the third is always omitted for this 
interface and the fourth is the 
\fIflag\fP
field described below. Any of the parameters may be omitted but the commas must be kept.
.SH FLAGS
The 
.I flags 
part of the configuration line enables/disables various interface and driver parmeters at boot time.
These parameters vary slightly from one interface type/vendor to the next, so make sure to 
look at the correct man page to get correct information.
.PP
The defaults are:
.nf
	Bus width:	Autodetect
	Buffer size:	16k
	Verbose msgs:	Off
.fi
As distributed, the settings in the 
.I /bootopts
file set the verbose flag (0x80) in the flags field to aid debugging.
.PP
.nf
	NAME		VALUE	FUNCTION
	ETHF_16K_BUF    0x02    Force 16k NIC buffer (default, not required)
	ETHF_4K_BUF     0x04    Force  4k NIC buffer
	ETHF_8BIT_BUS   0x10    Force  8 bit bus
	ETHF_16BIT_BUS  0x20    Force 16 bit bus (currently unused)
	ETHF_VERBOSE    0x80    Turn on console error messages
.fi

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
When the \fBne0\fP
interface has been configured into the running kernel via
\fImenuconfig\fP,
a boot message will indicate whether the configuration works or not. The following message indicates success:
.PP
.nf
eth: ne0 at 0x380, irq 9, (ne1k) MAC 00:1f:11:02:60:2d, flags 0x80
.fi
.PP
The interface was found at the specified I/O address, the displayed MAC (Ethernet) address 
was found and set. 
The interrupt line (IRQ) is reported but not tested or activated at this point. If the interface does 
not seem to work, the IRQ may be wrong.  
If the interface has several connection options (AUI, BNC and/or TP), the card may need to 
be configured specifically for the connection type in use.
.PP
If the interface is reported as 'not found' it is likely that the I/O address is wrong. 
.PP
.nf
eth: ne0 at 0x300, irq 12 not found
.fi
.PP
Check the configuration again – which on most reasonably modern NICs will mean firing 
up a configuration utility under MSDOS. Older NICs are configured via physical jumpers,
some have both, one jumper setting indicating 'soft configuration'.
.PP
If the interface seems to work but emit error messages while transferring data, make sure you set 
the
.I verbose
flag in the 
.I /bootopts 
configuration to get as much detail as possible. Refer to the FLAGS and ERROR MESSAGES sections
for details.
.SH 16 VS 8 BIT
The  most significant difference between the 
.B ne1k
and the
.B ne2k
is the bus width. The former supports the original PC/XT ISA 8 bit bus, the latter 
uses the PC/AT 16 bit ISA bus. Less obvious is the difference
in buffer space on the interface itself. While the 16 bit card has 16k 
bytes of on board buffer for packet data, the 
.B ne1k
has only 4k. This severely affects performance and reliability when running under ELKS. 
Some recent versions
of the 
.B ne1k
actually has 16k of buffer space available, and the driver is by default set up to use the entire buffer.
This improves speed of file transfers but decreases reliability and will cause 
many errors reported on the console. The reliability issue is taken care of by TCP retransmits, 
so the overall experience is still better with 16k buffer size.
.PP
However, in some rare cases,
the forced use of 16k buffer on a
.B ne1k
interface may cause the system to hang, requiring a power cycle to recover. if this becomes a problem,
change the configuration flags to force 4k buffer and also change the MTU in
.I /etc/net.cfg
to 1000. With these settings the 
.B ne1k
is as reliable as the 16 bit version and still reasonably fast.
.PP
Similarly, if a 16 bit interface is used on a system with only 8 bit ISA bus, the force-8-bit flag 
must be set to make it work. There is not autodetection of the bus width in the driver.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The driver will emit the following error messages, some of them only if the verbose flag has been set.
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: Damaged packet, hdr 0x%x %u, buffer cleared\fR
.fi
A damaged packet was found in the NICs buffer and is discarded, which will case a retransmit
if part of a TCP session. This will normally happen only if an 8 bit interface is run with 
16k buffer memory enabled. The numbers reported are from the interface's buffer header and
of interest only to driver developers.
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: Rcv oflow (0x%x), keep %d\fR
.fi
The interface was unable to handle the amount of incoming traffic and had to discard one or more packets.
Since incoming packets are transferred directly from the interface buffer to user space,
with no buffering by the operating system, this may happen frequently when under heavy load, 
in particular when using the 
.BR ne1k .
The first number is a status code from the interface, the second is the number of packets
kept in the interface's buffer. 
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: TX-error, status 0x%x\fR
.fi
A link level error happened during transmit. This should not happen and may 
indicate a physical problem with the network. In rare cases it may be an indication that
the network is really busy. Remember that these interfaces are 10Mbps, more often than 
not connected to a switch carrying Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet traffic. The broadcast
traffic on such segment may have bursts that the old interfaces have a hard time keeping up with.
This message is informational.
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: RX-error, status 0x%x\fR
.fi
A link level error happened during receive. This should not happen but may occur 
under heavy load when using the
.B ne1k
interface. It may also indicate physical problems with the network segment. This message is informational
and will be suppressed if the verbose flag is off.
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: Unable to use IRQ %d (errno %d)\fR
.fi
An interface is already using this  IRQ. 
Network and other ISA interfaces are configured during boot, but the IRQ is assigned at runtime,
when the actual interface is opened. Hence, it's OK to see several interfaces reporting the same IRQ at boot time.
However, if the IRQ is already taken when a device is opened, this error message will be triggered.
The conflict may be remedied by closing the offending device, but since the ISA bus does not
provide any standardized mechanism for releasing IRQs, it may be necessary to reboot in order to
reassign an IRQ.
.PP
.nf
\fIne0: No MAC address\fR
.fi
A boot time message indicateing that the driver was unable to extract the MAC address from the interface, 
and the configuration was aborted. 

.SH IOCTLs
The driver supports the following IOCTL calls:
.PP
.nf
	NAME		     PARAMETER		PURPOSE
	IOCTL_ETH_ADDR_GET   char[6]		Get MAC address
	IOCTL_ETH_ADDR_SET   char[6]		Set MAC address
	IOCTL_ETH_GETSTAT    struct netif_stat	Get stats from device
.fi
.PP
The 
.I ADDR_SET
ioctl is currently unused and disabled.
