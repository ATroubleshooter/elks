More programs are required to get a fully working ELKS system. Some of the
major priorites at the moment are a non-BSD licensed shell, and a reliable
text editor.

If you have any code you have ported to ELKS that you would like to see
incorporated into this package please mail ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk.
