# This Makefile contains the rules used to create a tree of files ready
# for turning into a root floppy image, and the command to turn the said
# tree into just such an image. It assumes that the following value has
# been defined before this file is included in any of the Makefiles:
#
#    BASEDIR       The relative path from the current directory to the
#                  directory containing this file. This is the same value
#                  used with Make.defs in this directory.
#
# In addition, the following values are assumed to be set for commands in
# the current directory only:
#
#    MIN_BIN       Commands to be placed in /bin on all systems.
#    MIN_SBIN      Commands to be placed in /sbin on all systems.
#    MIN_USR_BIN   Commands to be placed in /usr/bin on all systems.
#    MIN_USR_SBIN  Commands to be placed in /usr/sbin on all systems.
#
#    NET_BIN       Commands to be placed in /bin on networked systems.
#    NET_SBIN      Commands to be placed in /sbin on networked systems.
#    NET_USR_BIN   Commands to be placed in /usr/bin on networked systems.
#    NET_USR_SBIN  Commands to be placed in /usr/sbin on networked systems.
#
#    STD_BIN       Commands to be placed in /bin on full installations.
#    STD_SBIN      Commands to be placed in /sbin on full installations.
#    STD_USR_BIN   Commands to be placed in /usr/bin on full installations.
#    STD_USR_SBIN  Commands to be placed in /usr/sbin on full installations.
#
# For each command that is copied across, any file matching *.? will also be
# copied to /usr/man/man? where the two ? characters are the same digit.
#
# Note that the MIN_* values are implicitly included in the relevant NET_*
# and STD_* values, so should be omitted from the latter.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This Makefile uses these values to implement the following rules, used
# by all Makefiles underneath it:
#
#	make basepkg	Create the tree used for i86 ELKS distributions, with
#			the MINIMUM set of commands that are to be included.
#			This is used as a base for the other tree commands,
#			and copies the MIN_* values only.
#
#	make fullpkg	Create the tree used for a full non-networking ELKS
#			i86 distribution. This uses pcmin as a base, and adds
#			the remaining non-networking commands to it.
#
#	make netpkg	Create the tree used for a minimum i86 distribution
#			that includes networking support. This uses pcmin as
#			a base, and adds support for networking to it.
#
#	make maxpkg	Create a full tree of all commands available for ELKS
#			i86 distribution, including all networking commands.
#			This uses pcfull as a base, and adds support for
#			networking to it.
