# This Makefile contains the rules used to create a tree of files ready
# for turning into a root floppy image, and the command to turn the said
# tree into just such an image. It assumes that the following value has
# been defined before this file is included in any of the Makefiles:
#
#    BASEDIR       The relative path from the current directory to the
#                  directory containing this file. This is the same value
#                  used with Make.defs in this directory.
