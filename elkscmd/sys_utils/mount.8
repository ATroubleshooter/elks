.TH mount 8 "ELKS System Utilities" "ELKS" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
mount \- mount a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mount
[\-t fstype] device directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes the ELKS version of
.BR mount .
This version is extremely minimal and should not be used whenever using a
better version is practical.
.PP
.BR mount
takes as arguents the name of a
.I device
and a
.I directory
name to be used as a mount point. Once the filesystem on the
.I device
is mounted, its root directory replaces the
.I directory
given.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-t"
Specify the type of filesystem to be mounted. Default is
.B minix .
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
mount \-t minix /dev/bda1 /mnt
.LP
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Filesystem mounted successfully.
.TP
.B 1
Wrong number of arguments, or mount was unsuccessful.
.SH BUGS
Unlike more complex versions of mount, this one does not use an mtab file
to keep track of mounted filesystems, or refer to an fstab file for details
of filesystems and mount points.
