                                ELKS TO-DO LIST
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of things that need to be completed before we can realistically
release the stated kernel versions. If you see anything missing, please add it
at the appropriate point in this list.

===============================================================================

 *  Before 0.2.0 is released:

    *	Convert screen to compile for ELKS.

    *	Standardise Makefile rules so all modules that comprise part of the
	elksnet package are compiled using exactly the same ruleset at each
	stage of the compilation process. This eliminates bugs caused by the
	use of incompatible compilation options for different modules.

 * Before 1.0.0 is released:

    *	Convert wvdial to compile under ELKS.
